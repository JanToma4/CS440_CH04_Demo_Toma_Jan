For CS 440 test My justification here

I chose the GNU General Public License v3.0.

I chose this license because it would allow me to share my software and allow other people to freely use it
and change it without the restrictions that come with proprietary software. It would allow people to change the software
by either adding to it or making it better by fixing/finding bugs, and also it would allow people to use the 
software for whatever they need. Compared to proprietary software, which doesn't allow you to change the software 
or let you have access to the source code, and you almost always have to buy the software. Free software on the other 
hand lets you change and make it better in certain cases, this can lead to better software and allows people who 
don't really have the money to buy the software to work, learn and change the software. This can lead to collaboration 
and improvements to the software which can lead to new innovations and can benefit many people. This is known as
copyleft which says that the developer has copyrighted the program/software but allows other people to use, modify
and distribute it, but they have to follow the same agreements the developer used. They cannot add restrictions to
the software that would limit the use of it or take away the free distribution. So this makes a lot of software 
essentially free and and allows many other people to innovate using the free software and overall making better 
programs and software.
